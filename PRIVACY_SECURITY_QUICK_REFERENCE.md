# Privacy & Security Quick Reference

## 🎉 What Was Implemented

### ✅ Frontend (100% Complete)
- **PrivacySecurityScreen.tsx** - Full security management interface
- **Password Change** - Secure Firebase-based implementation
- **Settings Integration** - Privacy moved to Account section
- **UI/UX** - Beautiful gradient design with dark mode

### ⏳ Backend (Reference Code Provided)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/password-changed`
- **File**: `backend-reference/auth-password-changed-endpoint.js`
- **Purpose**: Log events, send notifications (optional)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Test the Feature Now

1. **Navigate to Privacy & Security**:
   ```
   Settings → Account → Privacy & Security
   ```

2. **Change Password**:
   - Tap "Change Password"
   - Enter current password
   - Enter new password (min 6 chars)
   - Confirm new password
   - Tap "Update Password"

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ Loading dialog appears
   - ✅ Firebase authenticates current password
   - ✅ Password updated in Firebase Auth
   - ✅ Success dialog (auto-closes in 3s)
   - ✅ Can log in with new password immediately

### Error Scenarios

| Error | Cause | User Sees |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Wrong Password | Incorrect current password | "The current password you entered is incorrect" |
| Weak Password | Less than 6 characters | "Password must be at least 6 characters long" |
| Mismatch | New ≠ Confirm | "New password and confirmation don't match" |
| Same Password | New = Current | "New password must be different from current" |
| Rate Limit | Too many attempts | "Too many failed attempts. Try again later" |

## 🔧 Backend Integration (Optional but Recommended)

### Minimal Implementation (5 minutes)

```javascript
// In your auth routes file
router.post('/password-changed', authenticateUser, async (req, res) => {
  console.log(`Password changed for user: ${req.user.uid}`);
  return res.status(200).json({ success: true });
});
```

### Full Implementation (with email notifications)

See: `backend-reference/auth-password-changed-endpoint.js`

### Environment Variables

```env
# Firebase Admin (required for backend)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# Email (optional, for notifications)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

## 📋 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Password change with valid credentials works
- [ ] Wrong current password shows error
- [ ] Weak password (<6 chars) blocked
- [ ] Mismatched passwords blocked
- [ ] Same password blocked
- [ ] Success dialog appears and auto-closes
- [ ] Can log in with new password
- [ ] Backend notification received (if implemented)

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: "User not authenticated"
**Solution**: Ensure user is logged in, try logging out and back in

### Issue: "Session Expired"
**Solution**: User needs to re-authenticate (log out and log in)

### Issue: Backend notification fails
**Solution**: This is OK! Password change still works. Check backend logs.

### Issue: "Too many requests"
**Solution**: Wait a few minutes before trying again (Firebase rate limit)
